    "description": "Kanye West's much-anticipated Adidas Yeezy Boost 700 MNVN is finally here, and it does not disappoint. The iconic mixed-material sneaker profile has been overhauled in favor of a sleek black nylon upper with heat-welded panels and an enlarged 3M '700' graphic along the lateral. This revamp also adds a heel tab and drops the Three-Stripes emblem for a more minimalist look. The Boost-enclosed midsole is paired with a herringbone-patterned rubber outsole for superior traction and durability.",
