# Nike

Collection of JS files which pull from nike

## Usage

Run the 'master.js' file which will automatically pull from each other js file pull all nike shoes from the [Nike Men's Shoes](https://www.nike.com/w/mens-shoes-nik1zy7ok) catalog

## Ouptut

master.js returns an array of 'shoe' objects which can be described in processURL.js

## Notes

- This was the first implmenetation of a Scraper for RLVNT and will be considered primitive compared to future scrapers developed.
- Depending on the amount of shoes in the catalog, it may or may not load all of them due to too much HTML being processed. This may be a machine-to-machine dependency, however
