    "description": "The MT580 is one of the most distinctive models in New Balance history, and not simply because of its chunky, Rollbar-equipped, trail design. Originally an obscure, regional adaptation of the 585, the 580 began to turn heads as a fixture on the trendsetting streets of Harajuku. When it served as the canvas for some of the first-ever collaborative releases, the 580 became legendary. The newly reissued 580 brings an icon back to life. The modernized look of a slimmed down toe and reduced collar height is combined with construction that comes as close to a one-to-one recreation of the OG materials, compounds, and features as humanly possible.",

    "description": "The 580 is one of the most distinctive models in New Balance history, and not simply because of its chunky, Rollbar-equipped, trail design. Originally an obscure, regional adaptation of the 585, the 580 began to turn heads as a fixture on the trendsetting streets of Harajuku. When it served as the canvas for some of the first-ever collaborative releases, the 580 became legendary. The newly reissued 580 brings an icon back to life. The modernized look of a slimmed down toe and reduced collar height is combined with construction that comes as close to a one-to-one recreation of the OG materials, compounds, and features as humanly possible.",

This unassuming, unpretentious versatility is exactly what launched the 574 into the ranks of all-time greats. As hybrid road/trail design built on a wider last than the previous generation’s narrow racing silhouettes, the 574 offered a uniquely versatile mix of new, different, uncomplicated, rugged, durable, and comfortable that was adopted as a closet staple across the globe. That’s why today, the 574 is synonymous with the boundary defying New Balance style, and worn by anyone. This edition, the 574 Legacy, updates the classic with an elevated aesthetic.",

    "description": "‘The most New Balance shoe ever’ says it all, right? No, actually. The 574 might be our unlikeliest icon. The 574 was built to be a reliable shoe that could do a lot of different things well rather than as a platform for revolutionary technology, or as a premium materials showcase. This unassuming, unpretentious versatility is exactly what launched the 574 into the ranks of all-time greats. As hybrid road/trail design built on a wider last than the previous generation’s narrow racing silhouettes, the 574 offered a uniquely versatile mix of new, different, uncomplicated, rugged, durable, and comfortable that was adopted as a closet staple across the globe. That’s why today, the 574 is synonymous with the boundary defying New Balance style, and worn by anyone.",

    "description": "The New Balance 5740 is the answer to a question that is simple, yet astronomical in scale. What if we updated the most New Balance shoe of all time – the 574? Despite its legacy of unassuming, almost effortless versatility, the original 574 was a unique design for its era, a hybrid road/trail design that didn’t lean on visible technical features. The 5740 approaches the hybrid concept with a few extra years’ worth of design developments to explore, and creates a new perspective on an iconic design. An overall sleeker silhouette provided by a slimmer last combines with a range of exaggerated features. The unique midsole combines a flared take on the classic 574 construction with ‘90s tech inspired details, while the mudguard and eyerow feature the distinctive wavy embellishments of the ‘80s.",

Stray Rats, a brand with lifelong connections to different subcultures, offer their own take on the iconic 580.

For avid runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike, the 990 was a mark of quality and superior taste. There have been updates to the design since ’82, and more color options, but the 990’s aspirational status symbol aura has never changed. Simply put, the 990 is the shoe so good, that we’ve never stopped making it.

The 574 was built to be a reliable shoe that could do a lot of different things well rather than as a platform for revolutionary technology, or as a premium materials showcase. This unassuming, unpretentious versatility is exactly what launched the 574 into the ranks of all-time greats. As hybrid road/trail design built on a wider last than the previous generation’s narrow racing silhouettes, the 574 offered a uniquely versatile mix of new, different, uncomplicated, rugged, durable, and comfortable that was adopted as a closet staple across the globe. That’s why today, the 574 is synonymous with the boundary defying New Balance style, and worn by anyone.",

For avid runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike, the 990 was a mark of quality and superior taste. There have been updates to the design since ’82, and more color options, but the 990’s aspirational status symbol aura has never changed. Simply put, the 990 is the shoe so good, that we’ve never stopped making it.

The Fresh Foam X 1080v12 represents a consistent progression of the model’s signature qualities. The smooth transitions of the pinnacle underfoot cushioning experience are fine-tuned with updated midsole mapping, which applies more foam to wider areas of the midsole and increases flexibility at the narrower points. The ultra-modern outlook is also reflected in the 1080’s upper construction.

For avid runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike, the 990 was a mark of quality and superior taste. There have been updates to the design since ’82, and more color options, but the 990’s aspirational status symbol aura has never changed. Simply put, the 990 is the shoe so good, that we’ve never stopped making it. The 990v3 features a premium upper construction and ENCAP midsole cushioning.New Balance MADE contains a domestic value of 70% or more. MADE makes up a limited portion of New Balance’s US sales.",

For avid runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike, the 990 was a mark of quality and superior taste. There have been updates to the design since ’82, and more color options, but the 990’s aspirational status symbol aura has never changed. Simply put, the 990 is the shoe so good, that we’ve never stopped making it. The 990v2 features a premium upper construction and ABZORB midsole cushioning.New Balance MADE contains a domestic value of 70% or more. MADE makes up a limited portion of New Balance’s US sales.",

The 57/40 approaches the hybrid concept with a few extra years’ worth of design developments to explore, and creates a new perspective on an iconic design. An overall sleeker silhouette provided by a slimmer last combines with a range of exaggerated features.

For avid runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike, the 990 was a mark of quality and superior taste. There have been updates to the design since ’82, and more color options, but the 990’s aspirational status symbol aura has never changed. Simply put, the 990 is the shoe so good, that we’ve never stopped making it.
